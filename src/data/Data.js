The backend will be developed with Spring Boot, a popular Java framework, to create RESTful APIs that handle HTTP requests from the frontend. Our backend will interact with a MySQL database, using Spring Data JPA to perform CRUD operations and manage data efficiently. The frontend will be built using React, leveraging React Hooks to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. This React application will communicate with our Spring Boot backend to retrieve and display data stored in MySQL.
